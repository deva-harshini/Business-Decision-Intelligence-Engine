# 📊 Business Decision Intelligence Engine

A **production-grade Business Decision Intelligence System** that continuously monitors KPIs, detects anomalies, forecasts future risk, and generates **explainable, actionable business decisions** through an automated analytics pipeline.

This project goes beyond traditional dashboards or ML notebooks and demonstrates how **data science systems operate in real businesses**.

---

## 🧠 What This System Does

✔ Monitors business KPIs (e.g., Revenue)  
✔ Detects abnormal behavior using statistical techniques  
✔ Forecasts short-term KPI risk  
✔ Quantifies confidence and validity of insights  
✔ Maintains full auditability (why an insight was generated)  
✔ Recommends **business actions** (Marketing, Finance, Ops, Product)  
✔ Exposes insights via FastAPI  
✔ Visualizes insights via Streamlit UI

## 🔬 Decision Intelligence Pipeline (Phases)

### Phase A — Production Data Pipeline
- Single command executes full analytics workflow
- Simulates Airflow / scheduled ETL jobs
- Ensures repeatability and automation

### Phase B — Confidence, Expiry & Auditability
- Each insight includes:
  - Confidence score
  - Validity window
  - Baseline metrics
  - Thresholds used
- Enables trust and traceability

### Phase C — Business Action Recommendation Engine
- Maps risks to **team-specific actions**
- Assigns priority and expected impact
- Converts analytics into decisions

🚀 Running the System

### 🔹 Step 1: Run the Production Pipeline
This generates KPIs, forecasts, and decision insights.

```bash
python pipelines/run_pipeline.py
```
###🔹 Step 2: Start FastAPI Backend
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
Backend available at:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Test API:
```bash

```

###🔹 Step 3: Start Streamlit Dashboard
(Open a new terminal)

```bash
streamlit run ui/app.py
```
The executive dashboard opens automatically in your browser.
